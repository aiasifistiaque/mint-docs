			<P>
				The image and file fields of your models pick from here, and anything uploaded in a form lands here too. Files have
				public links, so your website can show them. The bottom of the page shows how much space it uses. Anyone whose role
				can view records — or build — sees it in the sidebar.
			</P>
			<P>
				Whose library it is is the project’s choice (<A href='/projects#media-library'>Media library</A>): its own,
				named after the project at the top of the page, or the organization’s shared one, which every project set to shared
				sees. Your organization’s media is never visible to anyone outside it.
