			<P>
				Connect Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor or any assistant that speaks MCP (the Model Context Protocol) to one of your projects.
				Then say what you need — “a booking system with rooms, guests and payments” — and it looks at the models you have,
				plans new ones with you, and builds them in <strong>that project</strong> once you say go. Your own AI subscription
				does the thinking; MINT does the building, with the same checks as the model builder.
			</P>
			<P>It can also answer questions about your records — “which clients haven’t paid this month?” — if you let it.</P>

				A URL with the key in it is as secret as a password — don’t paste it anywhere public. Claude on the web and ChatGPT
				reach MINT over the internet, so they need its public address, never <C>localhost</C>.
