				Turn each on in <strong>Site setup → Server-side</strong>. Keys are kept on the server: once saved, the panel only
				shows that one is set, with Replace and Remove. Meta gets each page view from the pixel and the server with the same
				event id, so it counts it once; Google can’t do that, so page views go to Google from the browser only. Visitors are
				matched by IP address, browser and the platform’s cookie; an email or phone in a form is hashed before it’s sent.
			</P>
			<P>
				So a lead is matched to the visitor who sent it, the site adds <C>window.MintAnalytics?.headers()</C> to the headers
				of its own calls to the site API. Use Meta’s <strong>test event code</strong> while you check it in Events Manager →
				Test events, then clear it.

			<P>
				<strong>Redirects</strong> send an old address to a new page or another site — <em>301 permanent</em> when a page

				<strong>Check the site</strong> opens your live home page (the main domain, or the first domain) and shows each tag
				set here as <em>On the site</em>, <em>Check this</em> or <em>Not on the site</em>. It also finds tags the page adds
				by itself: the same ID twice means every visit is counted twice; another ID means the page has its own. Google Tag
				Manager confirms your container exists, and Meta confirms the Conversions API token is valid and made for your
				pixel. Each Tracking card shows its result from the last check.

				Asking the AI to rebuild or change the site updates the same pages, blocks and records rather than adding copies:

				you made in the panel to the same blocks.
