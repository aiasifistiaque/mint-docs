			<P>
				Creating a <A href='/models'>model</A> gives it a page. Pages lets you refine that page without touching the
				model: which columns the table shows, the filter buttons, the form’s layout and rules, the record’s own page and its
				tabs, the ⋯ menu on each row, actions on ticked rows. Click a page in the list to open its editor.
			</P>
			<P>
				The editor’s tabs each have a colour, used on the tab, its card on the Overview and the banner at its top:

				The <strong>Overview</strong> tab sums the page up — its columns, form, record page, filters and fields, and whether a
				draft is waiting — with each card opening its tab (<em>Change it</em>) or its preview. The header shows whether the
				page is <em>Live</em> or has a <em>Draft not published yet</em>.
			</P>

		<Section
			id='preview'
			title='Preview'
			lead='See the page before anyone else does.'>
			<P>
				<strong>Preview</strong> — in the header, the bottom bar, each tab’s banner and the Overview cards — opens a window
				with three pictures: the <strong>Table page</strong>, the <strong>Form</strong> and a <strong>Record page</strong>.
				They’re drawn from your changes as they are, saved or not, and filled in with your five latest records (placeholders
				when there are none). Nothing in the preview can be clicked; <em>Back to editing</em> closes it.

			<P>
				Each field’s expanded options set its label, the input the form uses (text, rich text, dropdown, tags, image picker,
				record picker…), how the table draws it, whether the column shows by default, and min/max. <C>createdAt</C> is always
				there and read-only.

		<Section
			id='settings-linked'
			title='Linked-record pickers'

			<P>
				<strong>Add new from the form</strong> puts a <strong>+</strong> beside the picker: adding a booking for a guest who
				isn’t in the list yet, press +, fill in the guest, and they’re picked.
			</P>
			<P>
				<strong>Which records are offered</strong> narrows the list with conditions — <em>is</em>, <em>is not</em>,{' '}
				<em>is one of</em> — against a fixed value or another field of the same form. On an invoice: offer only the projects

				of one field, and more. Drag to reorder.
			</P>
			<H3>Actions on selected rows</H3>
			<P>
				<strong>Select rows</strong> adds checkboxes and a menu for what’s ticked: export, delete (with undo), duplicate,
				archive, change status, compare, merge duplicates, print, set a field, and totals. Each needs the matching permission —
				see <A href='/records#bulk'>Working on many rows</A>.

		<Section
			id='table-status'
			title='Status moves'
			lead='Which moves “Change status” allows.'>
			<P>
				Under Bulk actions, <strong>Status</strong> picks the model’s status field (any options field). Every move is allowed
				until you switch one off — from <em>Paid</em>, switch off the rest so a paid invoice can’t go back.{' '}
				<strong>Ask for a reason</strong> makes each move need one; it’s kept in the record’s history.

		<Section
			id='table-totals'
			title='Totals'
			lead='“View total” for the ticked rows.'>
			<P>
				With rows selectable, the selection bar can add up the ticked rows: <em>Total amount</em>, <em>Average amount</em>,
				lowest, highest or count — across pages, counting only rows the person may see. Preset the calculations here, and
				choose whether people may calculate other number fields themselves.

		<Section
			id='table-upload'
			title='Bulk upload'
			lead='Many records from a file.'>
			<P>
				Switch on <strong>Bulk upload</strong> and the table’s ⋯ menu offers it. Upload Excel (its first sheet), CSV or JSON,
				then <strong>Check file</strong>. The first row names the columns — a field’s key or its label, any case — and the
				dialog downloads a template.

				items={[
					'Every row is checked like the add form would: required fields, allowed values, formulas, unique fields — against the table and within the file.',

		<Section
			id='filters'
			title='Filters'
			lead='The chips above the table.'>
			<P>
				Each card is one chip; drag to order them. The first four show, the rest go under “Show more filters”. Picking a field
				fills in a sensible type and options.

				holds.

		<Section
			id='form'
			title='Form'
			lead='The add and edit form, in titled sections.'>
			<P>
				A section has a title, an optional description and rows; a row holds one field or several side by side. Drag sections
				and rows to reorder. Fields not placed anywhere are listed, so none are forgotten.
			</P>
			<H3>Fields that show only when needed</H3>
			<P>
				<em>Make a field conditional…</em> shows it only when others hold certain values — “Company name when Type is Business”.
				Tests include is, is not, is one of, more/less than, is filled in, is empty, is on and is off; several conditions can
				all have to hold, or any one. Rules chain: a hidden field counts as empty to the rules that depend on it.
			</P>
			<P>
				The server applies the same rules: a hidden field’s value isn’t saved, and a required field is only required while
				it’s shown.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='view'
			title='Record page and tabs'
			lead='The record’s own page and its quick-view dialog.'>
			<P>
				A list of sections, each with a title and 1–3 columns. Start from the form’s layout or from all fields. A section can
				hold the record’s own fields, chosen fields of a linked record (“Guest · Email”), or a list of related records (a
				guest’s bookings, newest first).
			</P>
			<H3>Tabs</H3>
			<P>
				After <em>Overview</em>, add tabs that list records of another model linked to this one — a client’s invoices, an
				author’s posts. Choose the columns, rows per page, and table or cards. Each tab has its own search, and an{' '}
				<em>Add</em> button that opens the other model’s form with this record already filled in.
			</P>
			<P>
				Every detail page also has a <strong>History</strong> tab: who changed what, and when.
			</P>

		<Section
			id='source'
			title='Versions'
			lead='Every publish is kept.'>
			<P>
				The <strong>Versions</strong> tab lists each published version with its note, who published it and when.{' '}
				<strong>Load as draft</strong> puts an older one in the draft; publish it to roll back.
