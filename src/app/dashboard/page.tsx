			lead='Build → Dashboard chooses what your project’s home page shows.'>
			<P>
				Numbers, charts and short lists of recent records, from any of your models — this month’s bookings, revenue by month,
				orders by status, the latest sign-ups. It shows live numbers as you build. A new project’s home is empty until you
				save a dashboard here. Each project has its own.
			</P>

			id='layout'
			title='Arranging'
			lead='Widgets fill rows left to right, in order.'>

						<strong>Add</strong>: <em>Add number</em>, <em>Add chart</em> or <em>Add recent items</em> at the top.
					</>,
					<>
						<strong>Move</strong>: drag a widget onto another’s place.
					</>,
					<>
						<strong>Edit</strong>, <strong>duplicate</strong> or <strong>remove</strong> with the buttons in its corner.
					</>,
					<>
						<strong>Size</strong>: a quarter, a third, half, two thirds or the full width. Tablets give small widgets half the
						width; on phones every widget is full width.
					</>,

		<Section
			id='widgets'
			title='Widgets'
			lead='Every widget reads one model.'>
			<Terms
				rows={[
					['What it shows', 'Number, Chart or Recent items. Switching keeps the model, title and conditions.'],

			title='Numbers'
			lead='One figure: how many records, or the total or average of a number field.'>
			<Terms
				rows={[
					['Measure', 'Count, total (revenue, quantity) or average.'],

			<P>Hover a column, point or slice for its exact value.</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='recent'
			title='Recent items'
			lead='A short table of records.'>
			<P>
				Up to six columns, 3 to 20 rows, newest or oldest first — or highest first by a number or date (the biggest orders,
				the nearest due dates). The first column links to the record.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='filters'
			title='Conditions'
			lead='Count or list only some records.'>
			<P>
				Conditions on the model’s fields — <em>is</em>, <em>is not</em>, <em>is one of</em>: confirmed bookings only, paid
				invoices. A record counts when every condition holds.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='access'
			title='Who sees what'
			lead='A widget never shows anyone more than they could open themselves.'>
			<P>
				Everyone sees the same dashboard, but each widget fetches its numbers with the viewer’s own permissions. Someone whose
				role can’t see a model doesn’t see its widgets. Changing the dashboard needs the <em>Build</em> permission.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='preview'
			title='The preview'>
			<P>
				The widget dialog shows the widget with real numbers as you set it up, so you can try a measure or chart type before
				adding it.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='saving'
			title='Saving and resetting'>
			<P>
				Nothing changes until you press <strong>Save changes</strong> in the bar at the bottom; saving updates the home page
				for everyone at once. <strong>Discard</strong> drops unsaved changes. Leaving with unsaved changes asks first.
			</P>
