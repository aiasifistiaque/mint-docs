			id='organizations'
			title='Organizations'
			lead='Your company or team. Its members, roles and projects belong to it.'>
			<P>
				Signing up makes an organization with you as its owner. Everything you build lives in one of its projects, and
				everyone you invite joins the organization — not a single project. Nothing in one organization can be seen from
				another.
			</P>
			<P>
				<A href={`${APP_URL}/org/settings`}>Organization → Settings</A> holds its name, its <strong>country</strong> and the business
				details you gave at sign-up: business name, industry, team size, website, how you heard about us, and what you’re
				building. Changing them needs the <em>Edit the organization</em> permission.
			</P>
			<P>
				The country decides which payment providers the organization’s sites can take payments with — in Bangladesh,
				SSLCommerz and bKash as well as Stripe; elsewhere, Stripe. The settings show the ones on offer under the country.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='switching'
			title='Several organizations'
			lead='One account can belong to any number of organizations.'>
			<P>
				Your own organization and every one you’ve been invited to are listed under <strong>Your organizations</strong> on{' '}
				<A href={`${APP_URL}/projects`}>Projects</A>, with your role in each, and in the switcher at the top right under{' '}
				<strong>Organization</strong>. Pick one to work in it — the panel reloads with its projects.{' '}
				<strong>New organization</strong> (in the switcher) starts another, with you as its owner — give it a name and its
				country.
			</P>
			<P>
				Your account, password and two-step sign-in are the same in all of them; your role, and the projects you can open,
				can differ in each.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='members'
			title='Members'
			lead='Organization → Members lists everyone in the organization and their role.'>
			<P>
				Each member shows their name, email, role, the projects they can open, and whether they use two-factor sign-in. With
				the <em>Manage members</em> permission you can change someone’s role and projects from the list — it takes effect on
				their next click — or remove them.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='project-access'
			title='Which projects people open'
			lead='Each member opens every project, or only the ones you choose.'>
			<Terms
				head={['Choice', 'Means']}
				rows={[
					['All projects', 'Every project of the organization, including ones made later. The default.'],
					['Only these', 'Just the projects ticked. Others don’t appear for them anywhere — not in the switcher, not by address.'],
				]}
			/>
			<P>
				Change it from the member’s row on <A href={`${APP_URL}/org/members`}>Members</A> (the line with the folder icon). Their role still
				decides what they can do <em>inside</em> those projects. Owner and Admin always open every project.
			</P>
			<List
				items={[
					'Someone limited to some projects who creates a project gets access to it automatically.',
					'Deleting a project removes it from everyone’s list.',
					'An AI key stops working for a project its maker can no longer open.',

						On <A href={`${APP_URL}/org/members`}>Members</A>, press <strong>Invite</strong>.

						that works for 7 days.

						in, or signs in with their password. Either way, they land in your organization with that role and those projects.

				Waiting invitations are listed under <strong>Pending invitations</strong>. <strong>Resend</strong> sends a fresh link
				(the old one stops working) and gives it another 7 days; <strong>Cancel</strong> withdraws it.

		<Section
			id='invited'
			title='When you’re invited'
			lead='Invited to someone else’s organization? It joins the ones you already have.'>
			<P>
				Open the link in the email — signed in to the invited account, <strong>Join</strong> is all it takes. Or find it in the
				app: <strong>Invitations for you</strong> on <A href={`${APP_URL}/projects`}>Projects</A> lists every invitation sent to your
				email, with who sent it, your role and your projects — <strong>Join</strong> or <strong>Decline</strong>.
			</P>
			<P>
				Invitations show in the app once your email is verified, so nobody can sign up with your address and see them. Press{' '}
				<strong>Send a code</strong> there and type the 6-digit code we email you. Joining from an emailed link, or resetting
				your password by email, verifies it too.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='roles'
			title='Roles and permissions'
			lead='A role is a set of permissions. Every organization starts with three.'>
			<Terms

			<P>
				Make your own on <A href={`${APP_URL}/org/roles`}>Organization → Roles</A> — a “Viewer” that only reads, an “Editor” that changes
				records and builds. A role is a name, a description and the standard permissions, records first:

			<P>
				Record permissions apply to every model alike, in the projects the member can open — to keep someone to some work,
				give them only the projects it’s in. Owner and Admin always have every permission; Member’s can be changed. A role
				can’t be deleted while members have it or a pending invitation uses it — move them to another role first.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='ownership'
			title='The owner'
			lead='One person owns the organization.'>
			<P>
				Only the owner can delete a project that still has models and records in it, and hand the organization to someone
				else: <A href={`${APP_URL}/org/settings`}>Settings → Ownership</A>, choose a member, confirm. They become the owner and you become
				an Admin.
