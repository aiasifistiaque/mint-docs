			<H3>What the API does with a name it doesn’t know</H3>
			<P>
				It ignores it, so cache busters like <C>?v=2</C> are harmless — but so is a typo: <C>?staus=live</C> filters nothing.
				If a filter seems to be ignored, check the key in Models (it’s the key, not the label, and it’s case-sensitive). A
				value the API can’t read is an error instead, with the reason: <C>price=cheap</C> answers 400 “price must be a
				number”, and so does an operator the field doesn’t take, like <C>status_gte</C>.
			</P>
			<Note>
				Use underscores, not brackets: <C>price_gte=10</C>, never <C>price[gte]=10</C> (that answers 400). Keys with an
				underscore of their own work as they are: <C>contact_email=…</C>, <C>contact_email_contains=…</C>.

				It’s made from what the live API says it offers, so it always matches the switches above it — turn a model or an
				action on and its endpoint appears. Above the models, <strong>Lists: paging, sorting and filters</strong> sums up the
				query parameters and operators every list takes. Click an endpoint for the rest: a list shows its sortable and
				searchable fields, every filter its fields take (with their operators and allowed values) and example requests made
				from its own fields, each with <strong>Try</strong>; a create or update shows the body fields; every endpoint shows an
				example response. Endpoints marked <strong>Customer</strong> need a signed-in customer’s token. The customer sign-in
				endpoints are listed too, and for a website, the site and page endpoints.
