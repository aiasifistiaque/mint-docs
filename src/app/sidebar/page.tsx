				The top of the sidebar is yours: <strong>sections</strong> (headings with an icon, like “Sales”) and{' '}
				<strong>pages</strong> (links under them, like “Orders”). New models add their page to the section you chose when
				creating them; here you rename, reorder, hide and restrict them. Each project has its own sidebar.
			</P>
			<P>
				The <em>Audience</em>, <em>Build</em> and <em>Organization</em> sections below yours are fixed — they follow each
				person’s role.

			<P>
				A bar appears at the bottom as soon as something is unsaved. <strong>Save changes</strong> updates the sidebar at once
