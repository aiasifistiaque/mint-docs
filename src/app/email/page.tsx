				Until you add your email server, your customers get no emails from you — signing up on your sites still works.

			<P>
				Sending a lot? Gmail and Outlook limit how many emails a mailbox sends a day (a few hundred to two thousand). For
				newsletters, a sending service with SMTP (Brevo, Mailgun, Postmark, SendGrid, Amazon SES) works the same way:
				put in its SMTP server and the username and password it gives you.

			<P>
				The test goes out exactly like your customers’ emails. If it works, the page says <em>Working</em>; if not, it
				says why in plain words — a wrong password, a wrong port, a server that can’t be reached — and the same reason
				is kept until the next email goes out.
