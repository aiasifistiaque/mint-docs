			<P>
				A model is a list of fields. Creating one gives your project everything around it at once: a page in the sidebar with
				a table, search and filters, an add and edit form, a page for each record, a place on the dashboard builder, a
				permission for roles, and — if you want it — a <A href='/public-api'>public API</A>. Nothing to deploy;
				it’s live as soon as it’s created.
			</P>
			<P>
				Models live under <strong>Build → Models</strong> and need the <em>Build</em> permission. They belong to the open
				project only.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='models-wizard'
			title='Creating a model'
			lead='New model opens a step-by-step wizard. Nothing is created until the last step.'>
			<List
				ordered
				items={[
					<>
						<strong>Model</strong> — its title, record code and fields.
					</>,
					<>
						<strong>Settings</strong> — which fields are required, editable, searchable and sortable.
					</>,
					<>
						<strong>Config</strong> — the page: its heading, add and export buttons, the ⋯ menu on each row, bulk actions.
					</>,

						<strong>Form</strong> — the add/edit form’s sections and rows.

			/>
			<P>
				Every step after the first starts from sensible suggestions made from your fields, so you can press{' '}
				<strong>Next</strong> through them and change things later in <A href='/pages'>Pages</A>. Going back and
				adding a field adds it everywhere; your other changes stay. Progress is kept in your browser, so a reload carries on
				where you were — <em>Start over</em> clears it.
			</P>

				Rather describe it? <A href='/connect-ai'>Connect your own AI</A> — Claude, ChatGPT and others can plan and
				build models in your project from a conversation.
			</Note>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='models-names'
			title='Names and addresses'>
			<P>
				From a title like “Invoices” the builder makes the name <C>Invoice</C> and the address <C>invoices</C> — the page’s
				address in the panel and the model’s in the public API. Names belong to your project alone: other projects, and the
				platform itself, can have a <C>Client</C> or an <C>Invoice</C> without touching yours. Only if this project already
				has a model by that name is a number added (<C>Invoice2</C>), shown before you save. A few addresses are the
				project’s own — <C>customers</C> is your site’s signed-in customers — so a <C>Customer</C> model keeps its name and
				gets the address <C>customers2</C>.
			</P>
			<P>The name and address are fixed once the model exists. The title can change any time.</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='models-code'
			title='Record numbers'>
			<P>
				<strong>Give every record a number (code)</strong>, under the model’s <strong>Settings → Record numbers</strong>,
				numbers records as they’re created: a prefix, a dash and a padded number, like <C>INV-0001</C>. Two records created
				at the same moment never share one. Turning numbers on for a model that has records gives them numbers, oldest
				first; a new prefix applies from then on.
			</P>
			<P>
				Switching it on fills in a prefix from the title (Invoices → <C>INV</C>); change it, or clear it for plain numbers (
				<C>0001</C>). <strong>Next record gets</strong> beside it shows exactly what the next record gets.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='models-fields'
			title='Fields'
			lead='Each field has a name, a type, and whether it’s required.'>
			<P>
				<strong>Add a field</strong> first asks what it will hold — text, a number, a date, a choice from a list, an upload,
				a link to another record — each with a line on what it’s for; then you name it. The type can be changed later in
				the field’s row, and its picture at the start of the row shows the type at a glance.
			</P>
			<P>
				Under each name, in small grey letters, is its <strong>API name</strong> (the key): how your API, imports and
				formulas refer to the field. It’s made from the name until you change it. <strong>More</strong> opens the rest of a
				field’s settings, in groups: <em>In the form</em> (what it starts with — the default — and help text),{' '}
				<em>Limits</em> or <em>Length</em> (lowest/highest, fewest/most characters), the options or allowed values,{' '}
				<em>Table and search</em> (a column in the table, found by the search box, no duplicates, faster sorting and
				filtering) and the API name.
			</P>
			<P>
				Beside the list, <strong>Form preview</strong> draws the add form from your fields as you edit them — before you
				save.

		<Section
			id='models-sections'
			title='Sections and lists'>
			<P>
				A <strong>Section</strong> groups fields under one key — an address with street, city and postcode. A{' '}
				<strong>Section list</strong> is rows of the same fields, as many as needed — an invoice’s lines, each with an item,
				quantity, rate and total. Choosing either opens its own field editor, starting from an example you can change; the
				row’s “5 fields: …” button opens it again. Inside, fields can be text, long text, email, link, colour, number,
				formula, yes/no, date, options, image or file.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='formulas'
			title='Calculated fields'
			lead='A Formula field works itself out from other number fields.'>
			<P>
				Build it from the field list, the operators (+ − × ÷ %, brackets) and functions (<C>round</C>, <C>floor</C>,{' '}
				<C>ceil</C>, <C>abs</C>, <C>min</C>, <C>max</C>), or type it: <C>total - paid</C>,{' '}
				<C>round(price * qty * 1.05, 2)</C>. Over a section list, <C>sum(items.total)</C>, <C>avg(items.total)</C> and{' '}
				<C>count(items)</C>; a formula inside a row uses that row’s values (<C>quantity * rate</C>). <em>Try it</em> works it
				out on sample numbers.
			</P>
			<P>
				A formula field can’t be typed into: forms show the result as you type, and the server calculates it on every save —
				from the panel and from your API alike. Changing a formula recalculates existing records. Empty counts as 0; dividing
				by 0 leaves it empty.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='models-links'
			title='Linking models'
			lead='A “Link to a record” field connects two models.'>
			<P>
				A booking links to its guest; an order to its customer; a page to its parent page. The form shows a picker, the table
				shows the linked record by its <strong>display field</strong> (the first text field unless you choose), and the linked
				record’s page can list everything pointing at it as a tab — a guest’s bookings. A model others link to can’t be
				deleted until those fields are removed.
			</P>
		</Section>

		<Section
			id='models-access'
			title='Who sees the records'
			lead='Your role and your projects decide — and, where a model needs it, each record.'>
			<P>
				In your organization, a model’s records are open to everyone who can open the project and whose role has{' '}
				<em>Records: View</em> (Add, Edit and Delete likewise). To keep people to some work, give them only the projects it’s
				in — see <A href='/organization#project-access'>Which projects people open</A>.
			</P>
			<P>
				For confidential records — salaries, contracts, personal notes — switch on{' '}
				<strong>Let each record choose who can see it</strong>, under the model’s{' '}
				<strong>Settings → Who sees each record</strong>. Every record then has an owner (whoever
				created it) and a privacy, chosen in the form’s <em>Manage access</em> section:
			</P>
			<Terms
				head={['Privacy', 'Who sees the record']}
				rows={[
					['Only me', 'Its owner alone.'],
					['Private', 'Its owner and the people they add — anyone in the organization who can open this project.'],
					['Public', 'Everyone who can view the model’s records.'],
				]}
			/>
			<P>
				Only the owner can change who has access, or delete the record. The table gains Privacy and Owner columns and filters.
				Records that existed before you switched it on become Public, so nobody loses sight of them. Your{' '}
				<A href='/public-api'>public API</A> only ever reaches records marked Public, and anything your site sends in
				is Public.
			</P>
			<P>
				For the people using your site or app it’s different: a public model can be set to{' '}
				<A href='/public-api#who'>customers’ own records only</A>, so each customer sees just what they created.
			</P>

		<Section
			id='changing'
			title='Changing a model'

			<P>
				Edits are kept until you click <strong>Save changes</strong> — in the header, in the bar that appears at the bottom
				while something is unsaved, or with ⌘S / Ctrl+S. <strong>Undo all</strong> goes back to the saved model. A tab
				with a red number has fields that need attention.
			</P>
			<List
				items={[
					'Adding a field is always safe; it appears in the table, form, detail page and filters straight away.',
					'Removing a field hides it: the values stay in the records but aren’t shown or returned. Add it back to see them.',
					'Changing a field’s kind is flagged: old values stay as they were and may not read correctly as the new kind.',

				]}
			/>
			<H3>Turning off and deleting</H3>
			<P>
				Both are on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab. <strong>Turn off</strong> takes the page away but keeps the model
				and its records. <strong>Delete</strong> removes the
				model, its page and its sidebar entry; its records stay unless you tick “Also delete its records” and type the model’s
				name.
			</P>

		<Section
			id='features'

			lead='Several linked models at once — a whole feature from one description.'>
			<P>
				When your <A href='/connect-ai'>connected AI</A> builds a feature — say “bookings with guests, rooms and
				payments” — it makes the models, the links between them and the tabs on their pages in one go, all or nothing.{' '}
				<strong>Models → Features</strong> lists every feature built, with links to what it made. Everything it made can be
				changed afterwards like any other model.
